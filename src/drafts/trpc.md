# T3 stack first steps

> A blog is just like having a long conversation with people, so it should make sense that things you enjoy talking about will be closely related to your passion.

## Intro

-   A promise statement
-   There's a lots of opinionanted ways of do things nowdays. From Apollo graphql to NextJs
-   There are plenty of ways to build fullstack apps nowdays with different kind of tech      stacks and i a los of flavors
-   A preview of what's to come
    Today we will try to dive into the [T3 stack](https://init.tips/#why) and basically is a starting point to build a fully typescript app (frontend and backend)

## Overview

-   A simple definition
-   So as stated in their [github repo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app#about)

> *"(...)The "T3 Stack" is a web development stack made by Theo focused on simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety(...)"*

-   Examples
-   Transition to the next section

## Steps

  First you are going to be asked about your project name and if you prefer javascript or typescript. Then you are going to be able to select the following optional technologies

  - nextAuth
  - prisma
  - tailwind
  - trpc

  In this case we would need to choose which testing tools we will use in out projects since T3 create app doesn't prescript or suggest anything in this matter(which is good i think).

  For the sake of this article, we are going to select all of the tools in the list.
