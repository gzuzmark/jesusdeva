**Rytsas vys**Â â€“ I'ts difficult or maybe overwhelming to start a new thing, but I'm tired of thinking of this to much and just launch me to write about the stuff that I do(mostly aboud development). By the way I'm Jesus ðŸ¤™

This blog is built with astro + svelte and takes Astro - Ink template as an starting point. It's nothing too fancy but it should fill it's purpose.

Next stop should be a post about Nextjs + trpc and my thoughts about it.

Thanks for stopping by (â˜žï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž

```javascript
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```
